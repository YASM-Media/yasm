## Build Process

Here are the instructions on how to build and run this project on your respective systems.

- Clone the project on your system via GitHub.
- Make sure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your system since the whole build process depends on [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) itself.
- Create a [firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and fetch the web keys and save it as `firebase.env`, format as specified by [this file](./firebase.example.env)
- Create an [algolia project](https://www.algolia.com/) and create a new file named `algolia.env` and fill in the API keys as specified by [this format](/algolia.example.env)
- Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build` to build and run a development version of the application.
- Open up `localhost:3000` on browser to open up the website. If you want to communicate with the API, you can use the endpoint `localhost:5000` to access the same.
